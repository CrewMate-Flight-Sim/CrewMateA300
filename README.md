# CrewMate A310
<span style="font-size: 1.9em; font-weight: bold;">🛑 A310 WILL BE RETIRED, A300 WILL TAKE ITS PLACE.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.9em; font-weight: bold;">📉 THERE'S BASICALLY NO DEMAND FOR FLYING THIS TYPE IN FS2024. ON THE OTHER HAND THE A300 IS PROVEN TO BE A POPULAR TYPE IN FS2024, AND FLIGHT DECK LOGIC IS 90% SHARED BETWEEN THEM. SO THIS IS THE STEP FORWARD.</span>
